BasicCircuits 0.6
==================

The basic circuit package for [RedstoneChips](http://github.com/eisental/RedstoneChips). 
Includes many different kinds of chips that can handle binary numbers of any length (although sometimes limited to 32bit integers).

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/eisental/BasicCircuits/wiki/BasicCircuits-) for more info on building and activating circuits, and a full list.
